# File Processor with User Commands

This project demonstrates how to handle file uploads in a SvelteKit application and process them using the XLSX library. The goal is to allow users to upload a file (e.g., .xlsx), provide instructions for processing the data (e.g., removing duplicates or filtering), and return the modified file to the user after executing the instructions.

## Technologies Used

- **SvelteKit**: Full stack framework for building fast, modern web apps.
- **XLSX**: JavaScript library to read, write, and manipulate Excel files.
- **Zod**: For validating file uploads.
- **Superforms**: For handling form validation and submission.
- **TypeScript**: To ensure type safety across the project.
